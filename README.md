# genjs-cli

`genjs-cli` is a command-line tool that interacts with the [Anthropic API](https://www.anthropic.com/) to generate code templates based on custom prompts. This tool helps developers quickly create React and Node.js applications. With simple commands, you can initialize your project, set an API key, and clear previously generated files.

## Features

- **Initialize Projects**: Set your API key and custom prompts to generate code templates.
- **Interact with the Anthropic API**: Use custom prompts to generate Node.js and React code.
- **Persistent API Key**: The API key is saved in the local storage, so you donâ€™t have to input it repeatedly.
- **Interactivity**: During the `init` command, users are prompted for the API key and custom prompt if they haven't been set.
- **File Clearing**: With `clear`, users can remove all generated files with a confirmation prompt.
